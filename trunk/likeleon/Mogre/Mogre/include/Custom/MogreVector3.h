                The cross-product is normally used to calculate the normal
                vector of a plane, by calculating the cross-product of 2
                non-equivalent vectors which lie on the plane (e.g. 2 edges

                A vector which is the result of the cross-product. This
                vector will <b>NOT</b> be normalised, to maximise efficiency
                - call Vector3::normalise on the result if you wish this to
                be done. As for which side the resultant vector will be on, the
                returned vector will be on the side from which the arc from 'this'
                to rkVector is anticlockwise, e.g. UNIT_Y.CrossProduct(UNIT_Z)

				This is because OGRE uses a right-handed coordinate system.
            @par
                For a clearer explanation, look a the left and the bottom edges
                of your monitor's screen. Assume that the first vector is the
                left edge and the second vector is the bottom edge, both of
                them starting from the lower-left corner of the screen. The
                resulting vector is going to be perpendicular to both of them
                and will go <i>inside</i> the screen, towards the cathode tube
